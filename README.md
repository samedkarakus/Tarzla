# Tarzla – Multi-Brand Fashion Aggregator

tarzla is a modern fashion product aggregation platform built with React and Tailwind CSS. The goal of the project is to bring clothing products from multiple brands together in a single interface and generate revenue through affiliate programs.

---

## Overview

This project serves as a unified fashion discovery experience. Instead of browsing multiple online stores separately, users can explore curated fashion items from various brands in one place. When users click a product, they are redirected through an affiliate link, enabling commission-based monetization.

## Features

	•	Multi-Brand Product Aggregation: Pulls clothing products from different e-commerce platforms.
	•	Affiliate Monetization: Each product click redirects users via affiliate links.
	•	Clean & Modern UI: Built using Tailwind for a responsive and lightweight design.
	•	Fast Frontend Architecture: Powered by React and Vite.
	•	Category-Based Browsing: Users can filter and browse items by type, brand, or style.
	•	Scalable Structure: Easily extendable for new brands, APIs, and product data sources.

## How It Works

	1.	The system fetches product data from brand APIs or scraping services.
	2.	Products are displayed in a consistent card-based layout.
	3.	Users click a product to visit the seller’s website via an affiliate link.
	4.	The platform earns commission through these outbound clicks.

## This project aims to answer:

	•	Can a unified interface increase user engagement when browsing fashion items?
	•	Does simplifying product discovery improve conversion rates for affiliate programs?
	•	How effective is a multi-brand aggregator model in driving affiliate revenue?
